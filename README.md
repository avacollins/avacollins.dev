This repository is hosting my main portfolio website. The code is overkill for what it is, but that's the point. I am component/module/microservice fan and I have many years making highly customizable and scalable user interfaces for enterprise organizations. I love breaking up the bits and organizing them into their categories of function. It is very likely that you are here because I am looking for a position in your organization. If so please see the code separation and simplicity I embrace when crafting the frontend.
