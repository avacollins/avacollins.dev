The widgets were designed assuming dynamic backend data for user choices and product browsing, but the data was actually static upon page load. To address this, we hacked an AJAX proxy page via CMS to expose internal APIs by converting PERL query responses into JSON text on a page. This was before the fetch API was added to browsers, and asynchronous activity was more laborious to achieve. However, trusted iframes and JSON-formatted text were easy to grab from the DOM and parse into plain JavaScript in order to make dynamic widgets that required no page reloads.`
